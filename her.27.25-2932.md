# ICES advice on fishing opportunities
ICES advises that when the EU multiannual plan (MAP) is applied, catches in 2019 that correspond to the F ranges in the plan are between **115 591** tonnes and **192 787** tonnes. According to the MAP, catches higher than those corresponding to FMSY (155 333 tonnes) can only be taken under conditions specified in the MAP, whilst the entire range is considered precautionary when applying the ICES advice rule. This advice applies to all catches from the stock, including those taken in Subdivision 28.1.

# Stock development over time
Spawning-stock biomass (SSB) decreased until 2001 and then increased, and it has been above MSY Btrigger since 2007. Fishing mortality (F) increased until 2000 and then decreased, remaining below FMSY between 2004 to 2014. F has been above FMSY since 2015. Recruitment in 2015 is estimated to be the highest of the whole time-series.

</div>
<br>

The decreased catch advice is due to a change in the perception of the stock size. The stock size was downscaled and fishing mortality was upscaled due to the low survey indices in the last two years. There is also a downward revision of the 2014 year class.

## Catch scenarios plot

The following plot resumes Fishing mortality scenarios (see Table 3) and the related estimates of Catch and next years' Spawning Stock Biomass. Vertical and horizontal dashed lines show the available reference points (see also Reference Points section). 
In the hover text appearing in each point is indicated the value in tonnes (of Cath or of SSB) and the scenario represented. At the same time, in the horizontal axis will show up the corresponding F value.

# Quality of the assessment  
<br>
A high variability between years in the survey index, in particular in the last years due to the large year class of 2014, is the likely cause of the downward revision of SSB and upward revision of fishing mortality for the recent years. However, applying stochastic models (in this case SAM) to the data shows that these revisions are within the uncertainty bounds of these SAM estimates. 

Preliminary investigations indicate that the stocks of western Baltic spring-spawning herring (Division 3.a and subdivisions 22–24) and central Baltic herring (subdivisions 25–29 and 32, excluding Gulf of Riga herring) are mixing in subdivisions 24–26 (Gröhsler et al., 2013). The level of this mixing is presently unknown and its potential impact on the assessment should be investigated. 

Species misreporting of herring has occurred in the past (Hentati-Sundberg et al., 2014) and there are again indications that it is a problem in some nations.

# Issues relevant for the advice

<br>

The FMSY ranges in the EU Baltic Sea multiannual plan (MAP; EU, 2016) are consistent with the ranges provided by ICES (2015); these were evaluated to result in no more than 5% reduction in long-term yield compared with MSY. The ICES advice according to the MAP is based on the provisions of the plan and is considered precautionary. The ICES advice rule is used, i.e. F is adjusted by the factor SSB/MSY Btrigger when SSB is below MSY Btrigger. For this stock, the SSB in 2019 is above MSY Btrigger. In such a situation, catch scenarios applicable under the MAP correspond to fishing mortalities between Flower and Fupper. However, according to the MAP, catches corresponding to F higher than FMSY (i.e. Column B of Annex I in the MAP) can only be taken under conditions specified in the MAP. 

Under the EU landing obligation, which entered into force in 2015, up to 9% interspecies quota transfers are allowed for stocks that are considered to be within safe biological limits (EU, 2013 – Article 15). Quota transfers were not considered in this catch advice. To achieve FMSY exploitation, any transfer under this regulation should be accounted for in setting the TAC.

It should be noted that the large 2014 year class will be the main contributor to the yield in 2018 and 2019 and SSB in 2019 and 2020, and no substantial new incoming year classes are predicted. It is uncommon to see such large contribution of one year class to the SSB as seen in the short term prediction for 2019 and 2020. Three last year classes are below or at the average and if such a situation continues, a marked decline in biomass development can be expected.

<br>

**Figure 3**  Contribution to yield and SSB of successive year classes (ages 1–8+) as estimated in the short-term forecast for 2018–2020 under the TAC constraint in 2018. Herring in subdivisions 25–29 and 32, excluding the Gulf of Riga.

<br>

A mixture of central Baltic herring (subdivisions 25–27, 28.2, 29, and 32) and the Gulf of Riga herring (Subdivision 28.1) is caught in the central Baltic Sea. In the assessment and the advice the central Baltic herring stock is considered to be caught both in and outside the central Baltic Sea. The TAC (sum of the EU and the Russian autonomous quotas) is set for herring caught in the central Baltic management area, which includes also a small amount of Gulf of Riga herring caught in the central Baltic Sea but excludes central Baltic herring caught outside the central Baltic Sea.

The TAC value proposed for the central Baltic area is based on the advised catch for the central Baltic herring stock, plus the assumed catch of the Gulf of Riga herring taken in the central Baltic, minus the assumed catch of herring from the central Baltic stock taken in the Gulf of Riga. The values of the two latter are given by the average over the last five years.

*	Central Baltic herring assumed to be taken in the Gulf of Riga in 2019 (Subdivision 28.1) is 4363 tonnes (average 2013–2017);
*	Gulf of Riga herring assumed to be taken in Subdivision 28.2 in 2019 is 251 tonnes (average 2013–2017).

As an example, following the ICES MSY approach (here identical to the MAP FMSY), catches from the central Baltic herring stock in 2019 should be no more than 155 335 tonnes. The corresponding TAC in the central Baltic management area for 2019 would be calculated as 155 335 tonnes + 251 tonnes – 4363 tonnes  = 151 221  tonnes .
