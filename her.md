# ICES advice on fishing opportunities
ICES advises that when the EU multiannual plan (MAP) is applied, catches in 2019 that correspond to the F ranges in the
plan are between **115 591** tonnes and **192 787** tonnes. According to the MAP, catches higher than those corresponding
to FMSY (155 333 tonnes) can only be taken under conditions specified in the MAP, whilst the entire range is considered
precautionary when applying the ICES advice rule. This advice applies to all catches from the stock, including those taken
in Subdivision 28.1.
 <br> 

***

# Stock development over time
Spawning-stock biomass (SSB) decreased until 2001 and then increased, and it has been above MSY Btrigger since 2007.
Fishing mortality (F) increased until 2000 and then decreased, remaining below FMSY between 2004 to 2014. F has been
above FMSY since 2015. Recruitment in 2015 is estimated to be the highest of the whole time-series.

# Quality of the assessment  
***
<br>
The uncertainty in the assessment is relatively high, with large changes in biomass estimates in consecutive years. The model confidence intervals are an underestimate of uncertainty because they are narrower than interannual changes in estimates in consecutive years.
There is a lack of tuning data for the earlier years of the assessment, for some areas outside of subareas 7 and 8, and for the larger individuals in the population. Given the expansion of the stock into northern areas (ICES, 2017b), there is a potential that not all catches are reported for this stock. Biological sampling from these areas is also limited.
The data compilation of this stock is very complicated because it is exploited by several countries and the assessment model configuration is complex. In turn, the assessment model is very sensitive to the data and the settings used. Hence, it is extremely important for the quality of the assessment to have the complete data for all the countries on time and in the right format.
