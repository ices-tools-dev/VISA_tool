# ICES advice on fishing opportunities
<br>

ICES advises that when the MSY approach is applied, and assuming that discard rates and fishery selection patterns do not change from the average of 2015–2017, catches in 2019 should be no more than **3270** tonnes.

To ensure that the stock in Functional Unit 11 is exploited sustainably, management should be implemented at the functional unit level.

# Stock development over time
The historical harvest rate has fluctuated around FMSY and has been below FMSY since 2013. The stock has been above MSY Btrigger since 1998.

Catches (discard data only available from 1990), harvest rate (sum of landings and dead discards in numbers, divided by total abundance), survey abundance (Underwater TV, millions; SSB proxy; approximate 95% confidence intervals). Harvest rates before 2006 may be unreliable due to underreporting of landings. Orange lines represent MSY Btrigger and the FMSY harvest rate proxy.

# Quality of the assessment  
<br>
Since 1994 the underwater TV survey (UWTV) has provided abundance estimates by functional unit (FU) with acceptable precision. The UWTV survey for FU 11 does not cover Nephrops grounds in the inshore waters and sea lochs, waters that are typically fished by smaller vessels. The total area of these grounds is estimated to be less than 5% of the total stock areas and therefore the exclusion of these inshore areas from the survey is not considered to impact the quality of the assessment.

In 2017, observer sampling from the Scottish Industry–Science observer sampling scheme was extended to include sampling of Norway lobster catches in FU 11. As a result the sampling levels have increased and discard proportions are more precisely estimated.

Biological sampling for this stock is considered sufficient.

The long-term average (rather than a three-year average) was considered more appropriate as input for the mean weight in landings and discards in the calculation of catch scenarios. This is due to interannual variation.
<br>

# Issues relevant for the advice

<br>

From 2016, the EU landing obligation was applied to all catches of Norway lobster fisheries in ICES Subarea 6, with several exemptions. Observations from the 2016–2017 fishery indicate that some discarding above the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) continues and has not changed markedly (Figure 3). Consequently, ICES is providing advice for 2019 assuming average discard rates as observed over the last three years, which is considered to be a more realistic assumption.

For FU 11, the absolute density observed in the UWTV survey is intermediate compared to other Nephrops FUs, with an average density of around 0.6 individuals m−2. This suggests the stock may have a medium productivity capability. Historical harvest ratios in this FU have been around F35%SPR and landings have been relatively stable in the last thirty years. For these reasons, F35%SPR (combined between sexes) is considered to deliver high long-term yield with a low probability of recruitment overfishing and is therefore chosen as a proxy for FMSY.

A single TAC covers the entire ICES Subarea 6. Management should be implemented at the functional unit level to ensure that fishing opportunities are in line with the scale of the resource for each of the stocks and the corresponding MSY approach.
