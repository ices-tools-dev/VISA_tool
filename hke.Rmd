# ICES advice on fishing opportunities
ICES advises that when the MSY approach is applied, catches in 2019 should be no more than **142 240** tonnes. 
 <br> 

***

# Stock development over time
The spawning-stock biomass (SSB) has increased substantially since 2006 and is well above historical estimates. Fishing mortality (F) has decreased markedly after 2005 and has been below FMSY since 2012. The two most recent recruitment (R) estimates are above the average of the time-series.

* “Wanted” and “unwanted” catch are used to describe fish that would be landed and discarded in the absence of the EU landing obligation.
** SSB 2020 relative to SSB 2019.
*** Total catch 2019 relative to the catch advice for 2018 (115 335 tonnes).
^ Unwanted catch includes forecast unwanted catch (discards included in the assessment) and additional unwanted catch (the discards that were not included in the assessment, amounting to approximately 2.8% of the total catch).
^^ Catch option corresponds to F2018 = 0.25.
<br>
The catch for 2019 corresponding to the MSY framework is 23% higher than the advice given for 2018. The increase is mainly a consequence of the increase in SSB in 2019 as a result of strong incoming year classes.

# Quality of the assessment  
<br>
The model confidence intervals underestimate uncertainty as they are narrower than interannual changes in estimates between consecutive assessments.

The historical FR-EVHOE-WIBTS-Q4 survey was revised and produced some minor changes in the perception of the stock. The FR-EVHOE-WIBTS-Q4 index value for 2017 was not available. However, the IE-IGFS-WIBTS-Q4 survey and the discards also provide information on recruitment. Both indices are consistent in the historical period, hence the recruitment estimate from last year is considered reliable.

Not all discards are included in the analytical assessment, but they are included in the final advice catch estimates. They represent approximately 2%–5% of the total stock catches. Discards have decreased substantially this year.

Given the expansion of the stock into northern areas (ICES, 2017a), biological sampling and discard quantification may be limited.

Owing to a lack of French market sampling of length in Q1 and Q2 of 2017 (biological and onboard sampling was unaffected), for some sampling strata length data were supplemented using data from previous years, which is considered to have limited impact (ICES, 2018).

There has been a tendency for the assessment to underestimate SSB and overestimate F in past years. However, estimates of SSB in the current assessment are close to those estimated in 2017.

# Issues relevant for the advice

Discarding of juvenile hake (undersized and above minimum size) can be substantial in some areas and fleets. In the most recent period, discarding of large individuals increased because of quota restrictions in certain fleets. In 2017, observed discards decreased.

Some fleets fishing this stock have been under the EU landing obligation since 2016.

**Table 9** History of commercial catch and landings of hake in subareas 4, 6, and 7, and in divisions 3.a, 8.a–b, and 8.d, Northern stock. Both the official and ICES estimated values are presented by area for each country participating in the fishery. All weights are in tonnes.

* Spanish data for 1961–1972 are not revised; data for Subarea 8 for 1973–1978 include data for divisions 8.a,b only. Data for 1979–1981 are revised based on French surveillance data. Divisions 3.a and 4.b,c are included in the column "3.a, 4, and 6" only after 1976. There are some unallocated landings ( moreover for the period 1961–1970).
** Discard estimates from observer programmes. In years marked with # partial discard estimates are available and used in the assessment. For the remaining years where no values are presented, some estimates are available but are not considered valid and thus not used in the assessment. In the years with data only Spanish discards, and discards from French Nephrops trawlers are included.
*** The working group used total catches from 1978.
^ Unallocated landings for the years 2011–2014 were revised in 2015.
